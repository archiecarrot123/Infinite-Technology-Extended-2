Version: 1.0.4
Date: 2022.03.31
  Modding:
    - All technologies introduced before data-updates should be automatically
      updated to use toolbelt-1 instead of toolbelt in prerequisites
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 1.0.0
Date: 2022.03.22
  Major Features:
    - Added mod settings to allow turning features of the mod on and off
    - Added mod settings to allow changing of the effects of research
  Bugfixes:
    - Technology icons now have that little thing in the bottom right like vanilla ones
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.2
Date: 2020.12.23
  Bugfixes:
    - Toolbelt 5 cost error fixed
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.1
Date: 2020.11.28
  Changes:
    - Character inventory slots research now called "Toolbelt", doesn't respect locales correctly :(
    - Mod settings are now boolean instead of strings (you might have to re-set it)
    - Removed more unused code
    - Added thumbnail
  Balancing:
    - Toolbelt 2-4 are removed so that the technology doesn't get cheaper
    - Infinite technologies now require space science technology
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.1.0
Date: 2020.11.26
  Notes:
    - I just wasted an hour trying to figure out why it wasn't working, turns out Factorio doesn't 
      load outdated mods!
    - May want to integrate functions that are only used in single files
    - May want to rename character inventory slots to iterations of toolbelt
  Balancing:
    - Cost growth is now quadratic/exponential for most technologies. List:
      Weapon shooting speed: exponential, 2
      Laser shooting speed: quadratic
      Worker robots storage: quadratic
      Research speed: exponential, 2
      Braking force: quadratic
      Inserter capacity bonus: exponential, 3
      Laser shooting speed now has a bonus of 0.5 instead of 1.
  Changes:
    - Laser turret speed renamed to laser shooting speed, like in vanilla.
    - Updated to 1.1
    - Removed unused code.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Version: 0.0.1 
  Changes:
    - Updated to 0.18
  Issues:
    - Bob's mods have updated so much since release, so this mod no longer has support for them
